Hi! Welcome to my shell

I used Linux Ubuntu system for my assignment and ran it on  mimi.cs.mcgill.ca.

Notes:
-Please don't put space after the value when setting variables. (eg. set canada montreal NOT set canada montreal ).
-When using a test file as standard input please make sure the file ends with the quit command.
-Please do not end scripts with a new line.
